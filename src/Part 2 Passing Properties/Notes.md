Notes:

"All React components must act like pure functions with respect to their props." In other words, properties are read-only.
  Link: https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html#props-are-read-only

"Class components should always call the base constructor with props.
  Link: https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html#adding-local-state-to-a-class

Class components can also pass down properties to other class components, which can be reference with "this.state.props...".
